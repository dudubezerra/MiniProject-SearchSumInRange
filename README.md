## MiniProject: Searching a sum in a range
# 1. Introduction
 
 This little project is about searching a sum in a specific array.

# 2. The Problem

The sum problem is:
> Given the specific array of intengers: `A[]{ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 12, 18, 27, 31 }`, we must print a pair of numbers, and their indexes, wich is equal to the sum of a number entered by the client.
> If there is no pair in the array equivalent to the sum, we must show a message o failure;

## Example 

  If the client enter the number `3` we must print the the indexes `(0 , 1)` and their respective values ` 1, 2`.

# 3. Compiling and running

 To compile you may enter the following codes at the terminal prompt:

```
chmod 755 exec.sh

./exec.sh
```
 
 If the the program compile sucessfully then the script will automatically execute him.

 While the program is running you must enter an intenger to be found at the array, and that's it! :laughing:
